# GameOfNim

## Project Overview
This project implements the **Game of Nim** using Python.  
In this game, two players (MAXIMUM and MINIMUM) take turns removing one or more objects from a single heap.  
The player who removes the **last object loses**.  

The `GameOfNim` class defines the game rules and structure so it can be used with adversarial search algorithms such as **Minimax** and **Alpha-Beta Pruning** to play optimally against a human opponent.
